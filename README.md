# Sales-Analysis
##Regional Sales Analysis

This project analyzes 5 years of historical regional sales data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and presents insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard. The goal is to uncover trends, evaluate product/channel performance, and support strategic business decisions.

🧩 #Problem Statement
Sales and profit performance varies across U.S. regions, with limited visibility into:

Seasonal fluctuations

Top-selling SKUs

Profitability by sales channels

Goal: Use data to identify growth opportunities and improve regional sales strategy.

🔍 #Approach
The solution is divided into two phases:

#EDA using Python

Clean and transform raw sales data

Derive key metrics (e.g., profit, margin)

Visualize trends, correlations, and patterns

#Dashboard in Power BI

Enable slicing/filtering by product, region, time, and channel

Empower business users with real-time insights

🧪# Data Overview
Multiple datasets: Sales, Products, Customers, Budgets, Regions

Merged into a clean, structured dataset with key features:

order_date, customer_name, channel, product_name

Financials: revenue, cost, profit, profit_margin_pct

Geography: state_name, us_region, lat, lon

Planning: budget (2017)

📈 ##Key Insights
📆 #Seasonality: Revenue peaks in May–June; lowest in January

🛍️ #Products: 25 & 26 dominate sales (~25% of total)

🛒 #Channels: Wholesale = 54.1% of revenue; Export = highest margin

🌎# Geography: California leads in revenue; West region outperforms others

💰# Customers: Top customers contribute most revenue with >35% margins

✅ ##Recommendations
Offer seasonal promotions in April & January

Focus on high-performing SKUs; re-evaluate low-margin ones

Expand Export for margins, incentivize Wholesale for volume

Replicate California’s success in other regions

Monitor margins; analyze discount-heavy orders

🧰 #Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for EDA

Power BI for interactive dashboards

Excel for initial data storage and structure
